#  Getting Started with OpenShift Serverless Logic


Getting Started with OpenShift Serverless Logic
===============================================

Concept
-------

OpenShift Serverless Logic introduces the ability to run serverless applications on OpenShift. It leverages Knative, a Kubernetes-based platform for building, deploying, and managing modern serverless workloads.

Real-World Use Case
-------------------

This technology is ideal for applications requiring automatic scaling, event-driven processing, and reduced operational management overhead. It's beneficial for microservices, event handling, and applications with unpredictable traffic patterns.

Code/Config Example
-------------------

A typical Knative service, defined in a `knative.yaml` file, includes:

* `apiVersion`: Specifies the API version.
* `kind`: Defines the resource type, `Service` in this case.
* `metadata`: Contains the service name and namespace.
* `spec`: Holds the configuration for the service, including the container image, environment variables, and resources.

Daily Self-Assessment
---------------------

* Can you explain what Knative is and how it relates to OpenShift Serverless Logic?
* How would you set up a basic Knative service?

Practical To-Do Exercise
------------------------

1. Deploy a simple "Hello, World!" application using OpenShift Serverless Logic.
2. Trigger the application and observe its automatic scaling.
3. Modify the application to respond to an HTTP request.
