## Code/Config Example: Deploying with the Dev Profile

### Configuration for Dev Profile

To deploy a Quarkus application using the Dev profile on OpenShift Serverless, you need to configure your `kn` workflow and `config.yaml` file. Here's an example:

**kn workflow (dev-profile.yaml)**

```yaml
apiVersion: knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-quarkus-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: <your-quarkus-image>
        env:
        - name: KNATIVE_DEV_MODE
          value: "true"
```

**config.yaml**

```yaml
