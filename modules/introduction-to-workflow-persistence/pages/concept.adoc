= Concept: kn workflow CLI

The kn workflow CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool designed for managing serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless. It allows developers to create, execute, and manage workflows directly from the command line, providing a streamlined and efficient way to handle complex serverless applications.

With kn, you can define your workflows using YAML files, which are then executed by the CLI. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Version Control**: YAML files can be easily version-controlled, enabling collaboration and tracking changes over time.

2. **Declarative Syntax**: The declarative syntax of kn workflow YAML files makes it clear what each workflow does, enhancing readability and maintainability.

3. **Integration with CI/CD**: kn workflows can be seamlessly integrated into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, facilitating automated testing and deployment.

4. **Local Execution**: You can run your workflows locally using the kn CLI, which aids in development and testing before deploying to a serverless environment.

5. **Scalability**: kn workflows are designed to scale with your application, handling increased loads efficiently in a serverless environment.

In essence, the kn workflow CLI simplifies the management of serverless applications by providing a robust, flexible, and developer-friendly interface. It abstracts away much of the complexity associated with serverless architectures, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than managing infrastructure.
