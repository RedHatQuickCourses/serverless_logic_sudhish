= Concept: kn workflow CLI

The kn workflow CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool designed to manage and execute serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless. It provides a streamlined way to interact with Knative Serving and Eventing, enabling developers to create, deploy, and manage serverless applications efficiently.

The kn CLI offers several key functionalities:

1. **Workflow Creation**: You can create workflow definitions using YAML or JSON files. These definitions describe the sequence of steps, conditions, and parameters that govern the execution of your serverless application.

2. **Workflow Execution**: Once a workflow is defined, you can execute it using the `kn workflow deploy` command. This command uploads the workflow definition to the OpenShift Serverless instance and initiates its execution.

3. **Workflow Monitoring**: The CLI allows you to monitor the status of your workflows in real-time. You can view the progress of each step, identify any failures, and troubleshoot issues as they arise.

4. **Workflow Updates**: You can update existing workflows by re-deploying them with the `kn workflow update` command. This functionality enables you to iterate on your serverless applications quickly and efficiently.

5. **Workflow Deletion**: When a workflow is no longer needed, you can delete it using the `kn workflow delete` command. This ensures that you don't incur unnecessary costs for idle serverless applications.

In essence, the kn workflow CLI simplifies the process of developing, deploying, and managing serverless applications on OpenShift Serverless. By providing a command-line interface to Knative Serving and Eventing, it empowers developers to focus on writing business logic rather than managing infrastructure.
