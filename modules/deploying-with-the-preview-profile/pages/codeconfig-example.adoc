## Code/Config Example: Deploying with the Dev Profile

### Configuration

To deploy a Quarkus application using the Dev profile on OpenShift Serverless, you need to create a `kn` workflow. Below is an example of such a workflow configuration file named `workflow.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: knative.dev/v1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: my-quarkus-dev-workflow
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/quarkus/quarkus:21.1.5-java11
        name: quarkus-app
        env:
        - name: KNATIVE_DEV
          value: "true"
      resources: {}
