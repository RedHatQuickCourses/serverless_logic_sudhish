== Deploying with the Dev Profile

**Objective:** To gain hands-on experience in deploying a Quarkus application using the Dev profile on OpenShift Serverless.

**Instructions:**

1. **Set up your environment:**
   - Ensure you have OpenShift Serverless installed and configured on your OpenShift cluster.
   - Install the OpenShift Serverless CLI (kn) and Quarkus on your local machine.

2. **Create a Quarkus Project:**
   - Generate a new Quarkus project using the following command:
     ```
     quarkus@1.13.7.Final /home/user> quarkus create app.quarkus
     ```
   - Choose the 'RestEasy OpenAPI' quickstart.

3. **Configure the Application:**
   - Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties` and configure the following properties:
     ```
     quarkus.http.host = 0.0.0.0
     quarkus.http.port = ${port:8080}
     ```

4. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Use the kn service create command to deploy your application with the Dev profile:
     ```
     kn service create --image <your-openshift-registry>/<your-project>/quarkus-app --env PORT=8080 --profile development
     ```
   - Replace `<your-openshift-registry>` and `<your-project>` with your actual OpenShift registry and project name.

5. **Test the Deployment:**
   - Once the deployment is successful, invoke the service using its route to verify if it's working as expected.

**Reflection:**

- What challenges did you encounter during the deployment process?
- How did you troubleshoot these issues?
- What are the benefits of using the Dev profile for local development and testing?

== Integrating External Services (OpenAPI)

**Objective:** To practice integrating an external REST API into a Quarkus application using OpenAPI specifications.

**Instructions:**

1. **Choose an External API:**
   - Select a public REST API that provides data relevant to your interests or project.

2. **Generate OpenAPI Specification:**
   - Use an online tool or library to generate an OpenAPI specification (in JSON or YAML format) for the chosen API.

3. **Integrate the API in Quark
