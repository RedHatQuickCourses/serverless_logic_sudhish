## Code/Config Example: Deploying with the Dev Profile

### Configuration for Dev Profile

To deploy a Quarkus application using the Dev profile on OpenShift Serverless, you need to create a `kn` workflow. Below is an example of such a workflow configuration file named `deploy-dev.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-quarkus-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: <your-quarkus-image>

apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my
