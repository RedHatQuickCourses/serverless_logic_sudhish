= Concept: kn workflow CLI

The kn workflow CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool designed to manage and execute serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with Knative services, allowing developers to create, update, and delete workflows, as well as execute them locally or on a cluster.

The kn CLI is built around the concept of a workflow, which is a series of steps or tasks that are executed in a specific order. Each step in a workflow is represented as a Knative service, and the kn CLI helps manage the lifecycle of these services.

With the kn workflow CLI, you can:

- Create new workflows by defining a series of steps, each represented as a Knative service.
- Update existing workflows, adding, removing, or modifying steps as needed.
- Delete workflows when they are no longer required.
- Execute workflows locally using the `kn workflow run` command, which simulates the behavior of a workflow on a cluster.
- Execute workflows on a cluster, triggering the execution of each step as a Knative service.

The kn workflow CLI simplifies the process of managing and executing serverless workflows, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications on OpenShift Serverless. It abstracts away much of the complexity of working directly with Knative services, providing a higher-level, workflow-centric interface that is more intuitive for many use cases.

In the following sections, we will explore the real-world use cases of the kn workflow CLI, provide code and configuration examples, and offer practical exercises to help you get hands-on experience with this powerful tool.
