= Concept: kn workflow CLI

The kn workflow CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool designed for managing serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless. It allows developers to create, execute, and manage serverless workflows directly from the command line, providing a streamlined and efficient way to handle complex serverless applications.

The kn CLI supports various operations, including:

1. **Creating Workflows**: You can define your serverless workflows using YAML files and then create them in your OpenShift cluster using the 'kn workflow create' command.

2. **Executing Workflows**: Once your workflows are created, you can execute them using the 'kn workflow submit' command. This command triggers the workflow and its associated functions.

3. **Listing and Describing Workflows**: You can list all the workflows in your cluster using 'kn workflow list' and get detailed information about a specific workflow with 'kn workflow describe'.

4. **Deleting Workflows**: When a workflow is no longer needed, it can be deleted using the 'kn workflow delete' command.

5. **Tracking Workflow Executions**: The 'kn workflow logs' command allows you to view the logs of a specific workflow execution, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

The kn workflow CLI simplifies the management of serverless workflows, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy serverless applications on OpenShift. It promotes efficiency and productivity by providing a command-line interface that interacts directly with the OpenShift Serverless API, reducing the need for extensive configuration files and manual API calls.
