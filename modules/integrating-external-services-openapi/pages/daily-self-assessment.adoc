== Questions

1. **What is the primary function of the kn workflow CLI in the context of OpenShift Serverless Logic?**

   **Answer:** The kn workflow CLI is a command-line tool used to manage and execute Quarkus workflow projects on OpenShift Serverless. It allows developers to create, deploy, and manage serverless workflows, enabling event-driven architectures and efficient resource utilization.

2. **Describe a real-world use case for Quarkus workflow projects.**

   **Answer:** A real-world use case for Quarkus workflow projects is in building event-driven microservices. For instance, an e-commerce platform could use Quarkus workflows to handle order processing. When a new order is placed, an event is triggered, initiating a workflow that updates inventory, processes payment, and sends confirmation emails.

3. **What are the three deployment profiles discussed in the training content, and briefly explain their purposes?**

   **Answer:** The three deployment profiles discussed are:

   - **Dev Profile:** This profile is used for development and testing. It provides a quick and easy way to deploy applications without going through a full CI/CD pipeline.

   - **Preview Profile:** This profile is used for staging or pre-production environments. It allows for more rigorous testing and validation before moving to production.

   - **GitOps Profile:** This profile is used for production deployments. It ensures that the state of the production environment is managed and synchronized with a Git repository, enabling version control and easy rollbacks.

4. **How can OpenAPI specifications be used to integrate external services in a Quarkus workflow project?**

   **Answer:** OpenAPI specifications can be used to define the endpoints and data models of external services. By including these specifications in a Quarkus workflow project, developers can automatically generate client code that can call these external services, enabling seamless integration.

5. **What are the three authentication methods covered in the security section, and how are they configured in a Quarkus workflow project?**

   **Answer:** The three authentication methods covered are:

   - **HTTP Basic Authentication:** This can be configured in a Quarkus workflow project by adding
