== Deploying with the Dev Profile

**Objective:** To gain hands-on experience in deploying a Quarkus application using the Dev profile on OpenShift Serverless.

**Instructions:**

1. **Set up your environment:**
   - Ensure you have the OpenShift Serverless installed and configured on your OpenShift cluster.
   - Install the OpenShift CLI (oc) and the kn CLI.
   - Clone the provided Quarkus project repository.

2. **Build and Push the Quarkus Image:**
   - Navigate to the Quarkus project directory.
   - Build the Quarkus application using the following command:
     ```
     mvn clean package -Dquarkus.arc.config-sources=yaml
     ```
   - Push the built image to your OpenShift registry:
     ```
     oc new-build --strategy=docker --name=quarkus-app . --push-command=docker push
     ```

3. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Create a Knative Service using the kn CLI with the Dev profile:
     ```
     kn service create quarkus-dev --image <your-openshift-registry>/quarkus-app --profile=dev
     ```
   - Verify the deployment with:
     ```
     oc get ksvc quarkus-dev
     ```

4. **Test the Application:**
   - Get the route URL for your deployed application:
     ```
     oc get ksvc quarkus-dev -o jsonpath='{.status.url}'
     ```
   - Access the application using the route URL in your web browser.

5. **Scale and Uninstall:**
   - Scale the application to multiple replicas:
     ```
     kn service scale quarkus-dev --replicas=3
     ```
   - Uninstall the application when done:
     ```
     kn service delete quarkus-dev
     ```

**Daily Self-Assessment:**

*Q: What is the purpose of using the Dev profile when deploying a Quarkus application on OpenShift Serverless?*

*A: The Dev profile is used for local development and testing. It allows developers to run the application outside of a cluster, which is faster and more resource-efficient for development purposes. It's ideal for writing, testing, and debugging code before deploying to a production-like environment.*

*Example: When you're developing a new feature for your Quarkus application, you would typically use
