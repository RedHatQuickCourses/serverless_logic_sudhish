= Real-World Use Case: Quarkus Workflow Project for an E-commerce Platform

== Concept

In this section, we'll explore a real-world use case for Quarkus Workflow Projects, specifically focusing on an e-commerce platform. This example will illustrate how Quarkus Workflows can be utilized to automate and manage business processes, such as order processing, inventory updates, and customer notifications.

== Real-World Use Case

Consider an e-commerce platform that needs to handle a high volume of orders, manage inventory levels, and send automated notifications to customers. We can implement a Quarkus Workflow Project to streamline these processes.

1. **Order Processing**: When a customer places an order, a Quarkus Workflow can be triggered to validate the order, check inventory levels, and update the order status.
2. **Inventory Management**: The workflow can also manage inventory updates by deducting the ordered items and sending notifications when stock levels are low.
3. **Customer Notifications**: Automated email or SMS notifications can be sent to customers at various stages of the order lifecycle, such as order confirmation, shipping updates, and delivery notifications.

== Code/Config Example

Below is a simplified example of a Quarkus Workflow Project for the e-commerce platform use case. This example demonstrates a workflow for order processing.
