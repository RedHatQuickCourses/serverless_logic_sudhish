= Concept: kn workflow CLI

The kn workflow CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool designed for managing and executing serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with Knative Serving and Eventing components, enabling developers to create, deploy, and manage serverless applications efficiently.

The kn CLI offers several key functionalities:

1. **Workflow Creation**: You can create workflow definitions using YAML or JSON files, describing the sequence of tasks, their dependencies, and the resources they require.

2. **Workflow Execution**: Once a workflow is defined, you can execute it using the `kn workflow deploy` command, triggering the specified tasks in the correct order.

3. **Workflow Monitoring**: The CLI allows you to monitor the status and progress of your workflows, providing real-time insights into the execution of individual tasks.

4. **Workflow Updates**: You can update existing workflows by modifying the definition files and redeploying them using the `kn workflow update` command.

5. **Workflow Deletion**: When a workflow is no longer needed, you can remove it using the `kn workflow delete` command, ensuring that resources are cleaned up appropriately.

By leveraging the kn workflow CLI, developers can streamline the development, deployment, and management of serverless applications on OpenShift Serverless, focusing on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.
