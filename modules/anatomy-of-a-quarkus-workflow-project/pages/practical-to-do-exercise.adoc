== Deploying with the Dev Profile

**Objective:** To gain hands-on experience in deploying a Quarkus application using the Dev profile on OpenShift Serverless.

**Instructions:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have the OpenShift Serverless installed and configured on your OpenShift cluster.
   - Have the `kn` CLI installed and properly configured to interact with your OpenShift cluster.
   - Clone the provided Quarkus project repository.

2. **Build and Deploy:**
   - Navigate to the cloned Quarkus project directory.
   - Build the Quarkus application using the following command:
     ```
     mvn clean package
     ```
   - Deploy the application using the `kn` CLI with the Dev profile:
     ```
     kn service create --image <your-image-name> --env VAR1=value1 --env VAR2=value2 --profile dev <service-name>
     ```
     Replace `<your-image-name>` with the name of your built Quarkus image, and `<service-name>` with a name for your service.

3. **Testing the Deployment:**
   - Once the deployment is complete, use `kn` to expose the service:
     ```
     kn service expose <service-name> --port 8080
     ```
   - Test the deployed application by sending a request to the exposed service URL.

4. **Scaling and Cleanup:**
   - Scale the application to see how OpenShift Serverless handles the increased load:
     ```
     kn service scale <service-name> --replicas 3
     ```
   - After testing, clean up resources by deleting the service:
     ```
     kn service delete <service-name>
     ```

**Reflection:**

- Document the steps you followed.
- Note any challenges encountered and how you overcame them.
- Reflect on the benefits and limitations of using the Dev profile for development and testing.

== Integrating External Services (OpenAPI)

**Objective:** To practice integrating an external REST API into a Quarkus application using OpenAPI specifications.

**Instructions:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have an external REST API endpoint available.
   - Have a Quarkus project set up with necessary dependencies (`quarkus-resteasy-client`, `quarkus-openapi`).

2. **Define OpenAPI Spec:**
   - Create
