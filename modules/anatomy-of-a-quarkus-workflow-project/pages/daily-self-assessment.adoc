#  Daily Self-Assessment

```
= Daily Self-Assessment

== Purpose

The Daily Self-Assessment is designed to reinforce your understanding of the day's learning objectives and to encourage regular practice. It includes both conceptual questions and hands-on tasks to ensure a comprehensive grasp of the topics covered.

== Questions

1. **Conceptual Question:**
   What is the primary function of the kn workflow CLI in the context of OpenShift Serverless Logic?

   **Answer:**
   The kn workflow CLI is a command-line tool used to manage and execute Quarkus workflow projects locally. It simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and testing serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless.

2. **Conceptual Question:**
   Explain the difference between the Dev, Preview, and GitOps profiles in OpenShift Serverless.

   **Answer:**
   - **Dev Profile:** This profile is ideal for development and testing. It allows developers to quickly iterate and test changes without affecting the production environment.
   - **Preview Profile:** This profile is used for staging or pre-production environments. It provides a more production-like setting for testing changes before they are merged into the main branch.
   - **GitOps Profile:** This profile is used for production deployments. It ensures that the production environment is always in sync with the code repository, enabling continuous deployment and rollback capabilities.

3. **Hands-on Task:**
   - **Task:** Create a new Quarkus workflow project using the kn workflow CLI.
   - **Instructions:**
     1. Install the kn workflow CLI if you haven't already.
     2. Run the command `kn workflow create --name my-workflow --runtime quarkus` to create a new workflow project named 'my-workflow' using the Quarkus runtime.
     3. Navigate to the project directory with `cd my-workflow`.
     4. Execute the workflow with `kn workflow run`.
   - **Expected Outcome:** You should see the workflow executing successfully, with output indicating that the workflow has started and completed.

== Reflection
