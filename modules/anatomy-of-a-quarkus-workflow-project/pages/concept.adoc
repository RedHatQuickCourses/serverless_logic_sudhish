= Concept: kn workflow CLI

The kn workflow CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool designed for managing serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless. It allows developers to create, execute, and manage workflows directly from the command line, providing a streamlined and efficient way to handle complex serverless applications.

With kn, you can define your workflows using YAML files, which are then executed by the CLI. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Version Control**: YAML files can be easily version-controlled, enabling collaboration and tracking changes over time.

2. **Reproducibility**: By defining workflows in code, you ensure that they can be reproduced consistently across different environments.

3. **Automation**: kn workflows can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, allowing for automated testing and deployment of serverless applications.

4. **Extensibility**: The CLI supports extensions, enabling the creation of custom commands and workflows tailored to specific use cases.

5. **Local Execution**: kn allows for local execution of workflows, facilitating rapid development and testing without the need to constantly deploy to a serverless platform.

In essence, the kn workflow CLI empowers developers to manage serverless workflows with precision, control, and efficiency, making it an indispensable tool in the OpenShift Serverless ecosystem.
