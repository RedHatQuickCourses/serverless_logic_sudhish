#  Daily Self-Assessment

```
= Daily Self-Assessment

== Purpose

The Daily Self-Assessment is designed to reinforce your understanding of the day's learning objectives and to encourage regular practice. It includes both conceptual questions and hands-on tasks to ensure a comprehensive grasp of the topics covered.

== Questions

1. **Conceptual Question:**
   What is the primary function of the kn workflow CLI in the context of OpenShift Serverless Logic?

   **Answer:**
   The kn workflow CLI is a command-line tool used to manage and execute Quarkus workflow projects locally. It simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and testing serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless.

2. **Hands-on Task:**

   **Task:**
   - Navigate to your local Quarkus project directory.
   - Use the `kn workflow create` command to create a new workflow file, let's call it `my-workflow.yaml`.
   - Define a simple workflow in this file that includes a single step, such as an HTTP invocation to a test endpoint.
   - Execute the workflow using the `kn workflow submit` command.

   **Expected Outcome:**
   You should successfully create a new workflow and submit it for execution. The output should indicate that the workflow is running, and you should see the result of the HTTP invocation in the logs.

== Reflection

After completing the self-assessment, take a moment to reflect on the process. Did you encounter any challenges? Were the instructions clear? This reflection will help you identify areas where you might need further study or practice.

Remember, consistent practice is key to mastering these concepts. Make the Daily Self-Assessment a regular part of your learning routine.
