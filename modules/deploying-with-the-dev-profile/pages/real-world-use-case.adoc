== Real-World Use Case: Serverless Logic for an E-commerce Platform

In this real-world use case, we'll explore how OpenShift Serverless Logic can be utilized to build a scalable and efficient e-commerce platform.

**Concept**

OpenShift Serverless Logic allows developers to create serverless applications using Quarkus, a Kubernetes-native Java framework. This approach enables the creation of lightweight, fast, and scalable services that can handle a large number of concurrent requests.

For an e-commerce platform, we can leverage OpenShift Serverless Logic to build various microservices, such as:

1. **Product Catalog Service**: This service manages product information, including details, images, and inventory. It exposes an API for other services and external clients to access product data.

2. **Order Service**: This service handles order creation, processing, and tracking. It interacts with the Product Catalog Service to retrieve product information and updates the order status.

3. **Payment Service**: This service processes payments securely using external payment gateways. It ensures that payment transactions are handled efficiently and reliably.

4. **Notification Service**: This service sends order confirmation, shipping, and promotional notifications to customers via email or SMS.

**Real-World Implementation**

To implement this e-commerce platform using OpenShift Serverless Logic, follow these steps:

1. **Create Quarkus projects** for each microservice using the kn workflow CLI.

2. **Define REST APIs** for each service using Quarkus RESTEasy and JAX-RS annotations.

3. **Configure service dependencies** in the `application.properties` file to enable communication between microservices.

4. **Deploy services** using the Dev profile for local testing and iteration.

5. **Switch to the Preview profile** to test the platform in a more production-like environment.

6. **Finally, use the GitOps profile** to deploy the platform to a staging or production OpenShift cluster.

7. **Integrate external services** like payment gateways and email/SMS services using OpenAPI specifications.

8. **Implement security** using HTTP Basic, Bearer Token, or OAuth2 authentication for service calls.

9. **Integrate PostgreSQL** for workflow persistence and data indexing to store product information, orders, and user data.
