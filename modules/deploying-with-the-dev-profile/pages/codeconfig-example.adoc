## Code/Config Example: Deploying with the Dev Profile

### Configuration for Dev Profile

To deploy a Quarkus application using the Dev profile on OpenShift Serverless, you need to create a `kn` workflow. Below is an example of such a workflow configuration file named `workflow.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: my-quarkus-pipeline
spec:
  params:
    - name: IMAGE
      type: string
      description: Image reference for the Quarkus application
    - name: NAMESPACE
      type: string
      description: Namespace where the application will be deployed
  tasks:
    - name: build-and-push
      taskRef
