#  Daily Self-Assessment

```
= Daily Self-Assessment

== Purpose

The Daily Self-Assessment is designed to reinforce your understanding of the day's learning objectives and to encourage regular practice. It includes both conceptual questions and hands-on tasks to ensure a comprehensive grasp of the topics covered.

== Questions

1. **Conceptual Question:**
   What is the primary function of the kn workflow CLI in the context of OpenShift Serverless Logic?

   **Answer:**
   The kn workflow CLI is a command-line tool used to manage and execute Quarkus workflow projects locally. It simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and testing serverless workflows on OpenShift Serverless.

2. **Conceptual Question:**
   Explain the difference between the Dev, Preview, and GitOps profiles in OpenShift Serverless.

   **Answer:**
   - **Dev Profile:** This profile is ideal for development and testing. It allows for rapid iteration and easy debugging. Changes made in the Dev environment are not automatically promoted to higher environments.
   - **Preview Profile:** This profile is used for staging or pre-production testing. It mirrors the production environment closely, allowing for final checks before deploying to production.
   - **GitOps Profile:** This profile is used for production deployments. It ensures that the state of the cluster matches the desired state defined in a Git repository, enabling automated, reliable, and scalable deployments.

3. **Hands-on Task:**
   - **Task:** Create a new Quarkus workflow project using the kn workflow CLI.
   - **Instructions:**
     1. Install the kn workflow CLI if you haven't already.
     2. Run the command `kn workflow create --name my-workflow --runtime quarkus` to create a new workflow project named 'my-workflow' using the Quarkus runtime.
     3. Navigate to the project directory with `cd my-workflow`.
     4. Execute `mvn clean install` to build the project.
     5. Deploy the workflow locally with `kn workflow install --all`.
   - **Expected Outcome:** You should see the workflow being installed and ready for local execution.

== Reflection

After completing the Daily Self-Assessment, take a moment to reflect on what you've learned. Consider any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. This reflection will help solidify your understanding and prepare you for the next day's learning.
